# Carousel Component

Carousel Component Features

- Arrow Navigation: The carousel includes two arrow buttonsâ€”one for navigating to the next slide and one for going back to the previous slide. These arrows are clearly visible and allow users to manually cycle through the slides.

- Touch Swiping: On touch-enabled devices (such as smartphones and tablets), users can seamlessly swipe left or right to navigate between slides. This provides a natural and intuitive experience for mobile users.

- Bullet Indicators: The carousel also features bullet indicators at the bottom, which represent each slide. Users can click or tap on a bullet to directly jump to a specific slide.

* Accessibility (ARIA and Role):
  The carousel is accessible to users with disabilities by using ARIA attributes and roles to ensure that assistive technologies can correctly interpret the component.
